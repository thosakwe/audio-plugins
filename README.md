# audio-plugins
A collection of GPL-licensed plugins for Reaper (JSFX), and other DAW's
(VST/AAX/etc.)

These plugins can be used, free-of-charge. Be mindful of the [license](LICENSE).
You do not owe me any royalties when using them in your music, as per the license.
The GPL protects users, which is you.

## Licensing
For non-programmer folks - remember that it is important to comply with the license.
The source code must be available with any distribution of these plugins.

As a user, though, feel free to fork and modify these plugins.

## List of plugins
* `ref_track_toggle` - A Reaper JSFX that either plays a predefined audio file
(your reference track), or lets the underlying audio pass through. This can be
dropped onto your master track, and quickly toggled on/off to listen to a
reference track while mixing. :)
